## Hey there 👋🏻

I'm **Thomas**, a Senior ML Engineer who spends his days making neural networks go brrrr for autonomous vehicles. When I'm not optimizing training workloads or debugging why my model thinks a stop sign is a banana, I write about the messy reality of machine learning in production.

Expect posts about **ML engineering**, **software architecture** (and when to ignore it), and the occasional existential crisis about whether we're building the future or just very expensive pattern matchers.

Fair warning: I have strong opinions about code quality, questionable takes on design patterns, and an unhealthy obsession with making things run faster. You've been warned. ⚡
